The
economy
's
temperature
will
be
taken
from
several
vantage
points
this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
output
,
housing
and
inflation
.

The
most
troublesome
report
may
be
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
trade
gap
is
expected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
billion
from
July
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
survey
by
MMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Thursday
's
report
on
the
September
consumer
price
index
is
expected
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
Friday
in
the
producer
price
index
.

That
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason
the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
Friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

Economists
are
divided
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength
they
expect
to
see
in
September
reports
on
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
,
also
due
tomorrow
.

Meanwhile
,
September
housing
starts
,
due
Wednesday
,
are
thought
to
have
inched
upward
.

``
There
's
a
possibility
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
said
Michael
Englund
,
director
of
research
at
MMS
.

A
widening
of
the
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbate
trade
problems
--
but
the
dollar
weakened
Friday
as
stocks
plummeted
.

In
any
event
,
Mr.
Englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
narrowing
the
trade
gap
have
already
been
made
.

``
Trade
is
definitely
going
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
improvement
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

Exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
August
,
but
probably
not
enough
to
offset
the
jump
in
imports
,
economists
said
.

Views
on
manufacturing
strength
are
split
between
economists
who
read
September
's
low
level
of
factory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those
who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
employment
figures
in
their
calculations
.

The
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industrial
output
number
underscores
the
differences
:
The
forecasts
run
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
increase
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
MMS
.

A
rebound
in
energy
prices
,
which
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
consumer
price
report
.

The
consensus
view
expects
a
0.4
%
increase
in
the
September
CPI
after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

Robert
H.
Chandross
,
an
economist
for
Lloyd
's
Bank
in
New
York
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderate
gain
in
the
CPI
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
Auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
PPI
,
and
at
the
CPI
level
they
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
.

Food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanged
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Fleet\/Norstar
Financial
Group
.

He
also
says
he
thinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
excludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strong
last
month
.

He
expects
a
gain
of
as
much
as
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
summer
of
far
smaller
increases
.

Housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
August
's
annual
pace
of
1,350,000
units
.

Economists
say
an
August
rebound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
signaled
an
increase
in
September
starts
,
though
activity
remains
fairly
modest
by
historical
standards
.

Assuming
the
stock
market
does
n't
crash
again
and
completely
discredit
yuppies
and
trading
rooms
,
American
television
audiences
in
a
few
months
may
be
seeing
Britain
's
concept
of
both
.

``
Capital
City
''
is
a
weekly
series
that
premiered
here
three
weeks
ago
amid
unprecedented
hype
by
its
producer
,
Thames
Television
.

The
early
episodes
make
you
long
for
a
rerun
of
the
crash
of
1987
.

Let
's
make
that
1929
,
just
to
be
sure
.

According
to
the
program
's
publicity
prospectus
,
``
Capital
City
,
''
set
at
Shane
Longman
,
a
fictional
mid-sized
securities
firm
with
#
500
million
capital
,
``
follows
the
fortunes
of
a
close-knit
team
of
young
,
high-flying
dealers
,
hired
for
their
particular
blend
of
style
,
genius
and
energy
.

But
with
all
the
money
and
glamour
of
high
finance
come
the
relentless
pressures
to
do
well
;
pressure
to
pull
off
another
million
before
lunch
;
pressure
to
anticipate
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
...
''

You
need
n't
be
a
high-powered
securities
lawyer
to
realize
the
prospectus
is
guilty
of
less
than
full
disclosure
.

The
slickly
produced
series
has
been
criticized
by
London
's
financial
cognoscenti
as
inaccurate
in
detail
,
but
its
major
weakness
is
its
unrealistic
depiction
of
the
characters
'
professional
and
private
lives
.

Turned
loose
in
Shane
Longman
's
trading
room
,
the
yuppie
dealers
do
little
right
.

Judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in
the
early
episodes
,
Shane
Longman
's
capital
should
be
just
about
exhausted
by
the
final
13th
week
.

In
the
opening
episode
we
learn
that
Michelle
,
a
junior
bond
trader
,
has
indeed
pulled
off
another
million
before
lunch
.

Trouble
is
,
she
has
lost
it
just
as
quickly
.

Rather
than
keep
the
loss
a
secret
from
the
outside
world
,
Michelle
blabs
about
it
to
a
sandwich
man
while
ordering
lunch
over
the
phone
.

Little
chance
that
Shane
Longman
is
going
to
recoup
today
.

Traders
spend
the
morning
frantically
selling
bonds
,
in
the
belief
that
the
U.S.
monthly
trade
figures
will
look
lousy
.

Ah
,
perfidious
Columbia
!

The
trade
figures
turn
out
well
,
and
all
those
recently
unloaded
bonds
spurt
in
price
.

So
much
for
anticipating
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
.

And
a
large
slice
of
the
first
episode
is
devoted
to
efforts
to
get
rid
of
some
nearly
worthless
Japanese
bonds
(
since
when
is
anything
Japanese
nearly
worthless
nowadays
?
)
.

Surprisingly
,
Shane
Longman
survives
the
week
,
only
to
have
a
senior
executive
innocently
bumble
his
way
into
becoming
the
target
of
a
criminal
insider
trading
investigation
.

Instead
of
closing
ranks
to
protect
the
firm
's
reputation
,
the
executive
's
internal
rivals
,
led
by
a
loutish
American
,
demand
his
resignation
.

The
plot
is
thwarted
when
the
firm
's
major
stockholder
,
kelp
farming
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
,
hurries
home
to
support
the
executive
.

But
the
investigation
continues
.

If
you
can
swallow
the
premise
that
the
rewards
for
such
ineptitude
are
six-figure
salaries
,
you
still
are
left
puzzled
,
because
few
of
the
yuppies
consume
very
conspicuously
.

In
fact
,
few
consume
much
of
anything
.

Two
share
a
house
almost
devoid
of
furniture
.

Michelle
lives
in
a
hotel
room
,
and
although
she
drives
a
canary-colored
Porsche
,
she
has
n't
time
to
clean
or
repair
it
;
the
beat-up
vehicle
can
be
started
only
with
a
huge
pair
of
pliers
because
the
ignition
key
has
broken
off
in
the
lock
.

And
it
takes
Declan
,
the
obligatory
ladies
'
man
of
the
cast
,
until
the
third
episode
to
get
past
first
base
with
any
of
his
prey
.

Perhaps
the
explanation
for
these
anomalies
is
that
class-conscious
Britain
is
n't
ready
to
come
to
terms
with
the
wealth
created
by
the
Thatcherian
free-enterprise
regime
.

After
all
,
this
is
n't
old
money
,
but
new
money
,
and
in
many
cases
,
young
money
.

This
attitude
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
treatment
of
Max
,
the
trading
room
's
most
flamboyant
character
.

Yuppily
enough
,
he
lives
in
a
lavishly
furnished
converted
church
,
wears
designer
clothes
and
drives
an
antique
car
.

But
apparently
to
make
him
palatable
,
even
lovable
,
to
the
masses
,
the
script
inflates
pony-tailed
Max
into
an
eccentric
genius
,
master
of
11
Chinese
dialects
.

He
takes
his
wash
to
the
laundromat
,
where
he
meets
a
punky
French
girl
who
dupes
him
into
providing
a
home
for
her
pet
piranha
and
then
promptly
steals
his
car
and
dumps
it
in
Dieppe
.

In
producing
and
promoting
``
Capital
City
,
''
Thames
has
spent
about
as
much
as
Shane
Longman
loses
on
a
good
day
.

The
production
costs
are
a
not
inconsiderable
#
8
million
(
$
12.4
million
)
,
and
would
have
been
much
higher
had
not
the
cost
of
the
trading
floor
set
been
absorbed
in
the
budget
of
``
Dealers
,
''
an
earlier
made-for-TV
movie
.

Another
half
million
quid
went
for
a
volley
of
full-page
advertisements
in
six
major
British
newspapers
and
for
huge
posters
in
the
London
subway
.

These
expenses
create
a
special
incentive
for
``
Capital
City
's
''
producers
to
flog
it
,
or
a
Yank-oriented
version
of
it
,
in
America
.

Thames
's
U.S.
marketing
agent
,
Donald
Taffner
,
is
preparing
to
do
just
that
.

He
is
discreetly
hopeful
,
citing
three
U.S.
comedy
series
--
``
Three
's
Company
,
''
``
Too
Close
for
Comfort
''
and
``
Check
It
Out
''
--
that
had
British
antecedents
.

Perhaps
without
realizing
it
,
Mr.
Taffner
simultaneously
has
put
his
finger
on
the
problem
and
an
ideal
solution
:
``
Capital
City
''
should
have
been
a
comedy
,
a
worthy
sequel
to
the
screwball
British
``
Carry
On
''
movies
of
the
1960s
.

The
seeds
already
are
in
the
script
.

The
first
episode
concluded
with
a
marvelously
cute
scene
in
which
the
trading-room
crew
minded
a
baby
,
the
casualty
of
a
broken
marriage
at
the
firm
.

And
many
in
the
young
cast
bear
striking
resemblances
to
American
TV
and
movie
personalities
known
for
light
roles
.

Joanna
Kanska
looks
like
a
young
Zsa
Zsa
Gabor
;
William
Armstrong
,
who
plays
Max
,
could
pass
for
Hans
Conreid
,
and
Douglas
Hodge
(
Declan
)
for
James
Farentino
;
Rolf
Saxon
is
a
passable
Tommy
Noonan
and
Dorian
Healy
could
easily
double
for
Huntz
Hall
,
the
blank-faced
foil
of
the
Bowery
Boys
comedies
.

So
,
OK
kids
,
everybody
on
stage
for
``
Carry
On
Trading
''
:
The
cast
is
frantically
searching
the
office
for
misplaced
Japanese
bonds
that
suddenly
have
soared
in
value
because
Dai-Ichi
Kangyo
Bank
has
just
bought
the
White
House
.

The
pressure
is
too
much
for
Zsa
Zsa
,
who
slaps
a
security
guard
.

He
backflips
into
a
desktop
computer
terminal
,
which
explodes
,
covering
Huntz
Hall
's
face
with
microchips
.

And
all
the
while
,
the
bonds
are
in
the
baby
's
diaper
.

It
should
run
forever
.

Mr.
Rustin
is
senior
correspondent
in
the
Journal
's
London
bureau
.

Axa-Midi
Assurances
of
France
gave
details
of
its
financing
plans
for
its
proposed
$
4.5
billion
acquisition
of
Farmers
Group
Inc.
,
in
amended
filings
with
insurance
regulators
in
the
nine
U.S.
states
where
Farmers
operates
.

The
proposed
acquisition
is
part
of
Sir
James
Goldsmith
's
unfriendly
takeover
attempt
for
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
the
British
tobacco
,
retailing
,
paper
and
financial
services
concern
that
is
parent
of
Los
Angeles-based
Farmers
.

In
an
attempt
to
appease
U.S.
regulators
'
concern
over
a
Goldsmith
acquisition
of
Farmers
,
Sir
James
in
August
agreed
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
if
he
is
successful
in
acquiring
B.A.T
.

As
part
of
the
agreement
,
Axa
agreed
to
invest
$
1
billion
in
Hoylake
Investments
Ltd.
,
Sir
James
's
acquisition
vehicle
.

Of
the
total
$
5.5
billion
to
be
paid
to
Hoylake
by
Axa
,
about
$
1
billion
will
come
from
available
resources
of
Axa
's
parent
,
Axa-Midi
Group
,
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
the
form
of
notes
issued
by
Axa
,
and
the
remaining
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
long-term
bank
loans
.

In
an
interview
Thursday
,
Claude
Bebear
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Axa
,
said
his
group
has
already
obtained
assurances
from
a
group
of
banks
led
by
Cie
.
Financiere
de
Paribas
that
they
can
provide
the
loan
portion
of
the
financing
.

The
other
banking
companies
in
the
group
are
Credit
Lyonnais
,
Societe
Generale
,
BankAmerica
Corp.
and
Citicorp
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Bebear
said
Axa-Midi
Group
has
``
more
than
$
2.5
billion
of
non-strategic
assets
that
we
can
and
will
sell
''
to
help
pay
off
debt
from
the
acquisition
.

He
said
the
assets
to
be
sold
would
be
``
non-insurance
''
assets
,
including
a
beer
company
and
a
real
estate
firm
,
and
would
n't
include
any
pieces
of
Farmers
.

``
We
wo
n't
put
any
burden
on
Farmers
,
''
he
said
.

The
amended
filings
also
point
out
that
under
a
new
agreement
,
Hoylake
has
an
absolute
obligation
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
upon
an
acquisition
of
B.A.T
.

``
We
hope
that
with
what
we
did
,
the
regulators
will
not
need
to
evaluate
Hoylake
,
and
they
can
directly
look
at
the
agreement
with
us
,
because
Hoylake
wo
n't
be
an
owner
of
Farmers
at
anytime
,
''
Mr.
Bebear
said
.

Any
change
of
control
in
Farmers
needs
approval
of
the
insurance
commissioners
in
the
nine
states
where
Farmers
and
its
related
companies
are
incorporated
.

The
amended
filings
were
required
because
of
the
new
agreement
between
Axa
and
Hoylake
,
and
to
reflect
the
extension
that
Sir
James
received
last
month
under
British
takeover
rules
to
complete
his
proposed
acquisition
.

Hoylake
dropped
its
initial
#
13.35
billion
(
$
20.71
billion
)
takeover
bid
after
it
received
the
extension
,
but
said
it
would
launch
a
new
bid
if
and
when
the
propsed
sale
of
Farmers
to
Axa
receives
regulatory
approval
.

A
spokesman
for
B.A.T
said
of
the
amended
filings
that
,
``
It
would
appear
that
nothing
substantive
has
changed
.

The
new
financing
structure
is
still
a
very-highly
leveraged
one
,
and
Axa
still
plans
to
take
out
75
%
of
Farmers
'
earnings
as
dividends
to
service
their
debt
.
''

That
dividend
is
almost
double
the
35
%
currently
taken
out
of
Farmers
by
B.A.T
,
the
spokesman
added
.

``
It
would
have
severe
implications
for
Farmers
'
policy
holders
.
''

To
fend
off
Sir
James
's
advances
,
B.A.T
has
proposed
a
sweeping
restructuring
that
would
pare
it
to
a
tobacco
and
financial
services
concern
.

Dismal
sales
at
General
Motors
Corp.
dragged
the
U.S.
car
and
truck
market
down
below
year-ago
levels
in
early
October
,
the
first
sales
period
of
the
1990
model
year
.

The
eight
major
domestic
auto
makers
sold
160,510
North
American-made
cars
in
the
first
10
days
of
October
,
a
12.6
%
drop
from
a
year
earlier
.

Domestically
built
truck
sales
were
down
10.4
%
to
86,555
pickups
,
vans
and
sport
utility
vehicles
.

The
heavy
use
of
incentives
to
clear
out
1989
models
appears
to
have
taken
the
steam
,
at
least
initially
,
out
of
1990
model
sales
,
which
began
officially
Oct.
1
.

This
appears
particularly
true
at
GM
,
which
had
strong
sales
in
August
and
September
but
saw
its
early
October
car
and
truck
results
fall
26.3
%
from
last
year
's
unusually
high
level
.

Overall
,
sales
of
all
domestic-made
vehicles
fell
11.9
%
from
a
year
ago
.

Without
GM
,
overall
sales
for
the
other
U.S.
automakers
were
roughly
flat
with
1989
results
.

Some
of
the
U.S.
auto
makers
have
already
adopted
incentives
on
many
1990
models
,
but
they
may
have
to
broaden
their
programs
to
keep
sales
up
.

``
We
've
created
a
condition
where
,
without
incentives
,
it
's
a
tough
market
,
''
said
Tom
Kelly
,
sales
manager
for
Bill
Wink
Chevrolet
in
Dearborn
,
Mich
.

Car
sales
fell
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
selling
rate
of
5.8
million
vehicles
,
the
lowest
since
October
1987
.

The
poor
performance
contrasts
with
a
robust
selling
rate
of
almost
eight
million
last
month
.

Furthermore
,
dealers
contacted
late
last
week
said
they
could
n't
see
any
immediate
impact
on
sales
of
Friday
's
steep
market
decline
.

GM
's
domestic
car
sales
dropped
24.3
%
and
its
domestic
trucks
were
down
an
even
steeper
28.7
%
from
the
same
period
a
year
ago
.

All
of
the
GM
divisions
except
Cadillac
showed
big
declines
.

Cadillac
posted
a
3.2
%
increase
despite
new
competition
from
Lexus
,
the
fledging
luxury-car
division
of
Toyota
Motor
Corp
.

Lexus
sales
were
n't
available
;
the
cars
are
imported
and
Toyota
reports
their
sales
only
at
month-end
.

The
sales
drop
for
the
No.
1
car
maker
may
have
been
caused
in
part
by
the
end
in
September
of
dealer
incentives
that
GM
offered
in
addition
to
consumer
rebates
and
low-interest
financing
,
a
company
spokesman
said
.

Last
year
,
GM
had
a
different
program
in
place
that
continued
rewarding
dealers
until
all
the
1989
models
had
been
sold
.

Aside
from
GM
,
other
car
makers
posted
generally
mixed
results
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
had
a
1.8
%
drop
in
domestic
car
sales
but
a
2.4
%
increase
in
domestic
truck
sales
.

Chrysler
Corp.
had
a
7.5
%
drop
in
car
sales
,
echoing
its
generally
slow
performance
all
year
.

However
,
sales
of
trucks
,
including
the
company
's
popular
minivans
,
rose
4.3
%
.

Honda
Motor
Co.
's
sales
of
domestically
built
vehicles
plunged
21.7
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

Honda
's
plant
in
Marysville
,
Ohio
,
was
gearing
up
to
build
1990
model
Accords
,
a
Honda
spokesman
said
.

``
We
're
really
confident
everything
will
bounce
back
to
normal
,
''
he
added
.

Separately
,
Chrysler
said
firm
prices
on
its
1990-model
domestic
cars
and
minivans
will
rise
an
average
of
5
%
over
comparably
equipped
1989
models
.

Firm
prices
were
generally
in
line
with
the
tentative
prices
announced
earlier
this
fall
.

At
that
time
,
Chrysler
said
base
prices
,
which
are
n't
adjusted
for
equipment
changes
,
would
rise
between
4
%
and
9
%
on
most
vehicle
.

Antonio
L.
Savoca
,
66
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Atlantic
Research
Corp.
subsidiary
.

Mr.
Savoca
had
been
a
consultant
to
the
subsidiary
's
rocket-propulsion
operations
.

Mr.
Savoca
succeeds
William
H.
Borten
,
who
resigned
to
pursue
personal
interests
.

Sequa
makes
and
repairs
jet
engines
.

It
also
has
interests
in
military
electronics
and
electro-optics
,
marine
transportation
and
machinery
used
to
make
food
and
beverage
cans
.

It
was
n't
so
long
ago
that
a
radio
network
funded
by
the
U.S.
Congress
--
and
originally
by
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
--
was
accused
by
officials
here
of
employing
propagandists
,
imperialists
and
spies
.

Now
,
the
network
has
opened
a
news
bureau
in
the
Hungarian
capital
.

Employees
held
an
open
house
to
celebrate
and
even
hung
out
a
sign
:
``
Szabad
Europa
Radio
''
--
Radio
Free
Europe
.

``
I
think
this
is
a
victory
for
the
radio
,
''
says
Barnabas
de
Bueky
,
a
55-year-old
former
Hungarian
refugee
who
works
in
the
Munich
,
West
Germany
,
headquarters
as
deputy
director
of
the
Hungarian
service
.

In
fact
,
the
network
hopes
to
set
up
offices
in
Warsaw
and
anywhere
else
in
the
East
Bloc
that
will
have
it
.

But
the
rapid
changes
brought
on
by
glasnost
and
open
borders
are
altering
the
network
's
life
in
more
ways
than
one
.

In
fact
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
in
danger
of
suffering
from
its
success
.

While
the
network
currently
can
operate
freely
in
Budapest
,
so
can
others
.

In
addition
,
competition
for
listeners
is
getting
tougher
in
many
ways
than
when
broadcasting
here
was
strictly
controlled
.

Instead
of
being
denounced
as
an
evil
agent
of
imperialism
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
more
likely
to
draw
the
criticism
that
its
programs
are
too
tame
,
even
boring
.

``
They
have
a
lot
to
do
these
days
to
compete
with
Hungarian
radio
,
''
says
Andrew
Deak
,
a
computer-science
student
at
the
Technical
University
in
Budapest
.

``
The
Hungarian
{
radio
}
reporters
seem
better
informed
and
more
critical
about
about
what
's
going
on
here
.
''

Indeed
,
Hungary
is
in
the
midst
of
a
media
explosion
.

Boys
on
busy
street
corners
peddle
newspapers
of
every
political
stripe
.

Newsstands
are
packed
with
a
colorful
array
of
magazines
.

Radio
and
television
are
getting
livelier
and
bolder
.

The
British
Broadcasting
Corp.
and
the
U.S.
State
Department
's
Voice
of
America
broadcast
over
Hungarian
airwaves
,
though
only
a
few
hours
a
day
each
in
Hungarian
.

Australian
press
magnate
Rupert
Murdoch
has
bought
50
%
stakes
in
two
popular
and
gossipy
Hungarian
newspapers
,
while
Britain
's
Robert
Maxwell
has
let
it
be
known
here
that
he
is
thinking
about
similar
moves
.

But
Radio
Free
Europe
does
n't
plan
to
fade
away
.

With
its
mission
for
free
speech
and
the
capitalist
way
,
the
network
's
staff
says
it
still
has
plenty
to
do
--
in
Hungary
and
in
the
``
Great
Eastern
Beyond
.
